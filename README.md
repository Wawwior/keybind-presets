## Keybind Profiles

Keybind Profiles is a small mod i wrote to use different sets of Keybinds on different occasions.

It is fully compatible with [Amecs](https://modrinth.com/mod/amecs).

The core functionality is just that, adding the possibility to save and load keybinds, the later optionally via a command (/keybind load <profile>).

More features (like server/world specific profiles) are to be expected in the future, as well as optimization and compatibility fixes. I will also be expanding on the command system if i deem it necessary.
